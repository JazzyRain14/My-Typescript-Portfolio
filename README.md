## 👋 About Me

Hi! I’m a front-end developer currently learning **React** and **TypeScript**.  
This project is part of my learning journey and includes:

- A Todo App 📝
- An Ingredient Finder App 🍽️ (using TheMealDB API)
- And more experimental pages...

I enjoy building with **Tailwind CSS**, **DaisyUI**, and exploring real-world APIs.  
This site helps me practice everything from routing and state management to API integration and UI design.

Thanks for checking out my work!
